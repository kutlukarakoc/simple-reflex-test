## Simple Reflex Text Project

### Live demo : https://simple-reflex-tester.netlify.app/
### To build this project, I used vanilla javascript.
### When you ready to test your reflex, just click on the start button. After that, wait for the green screen. When you see the green screen, just click somewhere and you will see your result. If you want to try again, just refresh the page.
